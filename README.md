### Milestone 1 (Nov Week 1): Project Proposal & API Design

- **What we'll do:**
  - This week, our team will finalize the project topic “Student Organization Profiling System (SOPS)” and define its core features such as member profiling and role-based access control (RBAC).
  - We will write the Problem Statement, Goals, and create initial data models (User, Member).
  - We will also draft the initial API documentation outline using OpenAPI (Swagger) for at least 3 planned endpoints (e.g., `/members`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`).

- **Deliverables:**
  - Updated `README.md` file containing:
    - Problem Statement
    - Project Goals
    - Basic Data Models (User and Member)
  - A new file named `api.yaml` (or `.yml`) containing the initial OpenAPI documentation with at least 3 endpoints relevant to SOPS.

- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Hold team meeting to confirm topic and assigned roles
  - [ ] Add all members and their GitHub profiles in `README.md`
  - [ ] Write “Problem Statement” and “Goals” sections
  - [ ] Define initial data models for “User” and “Member”
  - [ ] Create `api.yaml` in Swagger Editor and include at least 3 endpoints
  - [ ] Commit and push all changes (README.md + api.yaml) to GitHub
